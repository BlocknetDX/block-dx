          Using Block DX is cheaper than using centralized exchanges, especially since there are no withdrawal fees. Below is 
          Block DXâ€™s fee structure. For the most up-to-date information on fees, <a href="#" class="blocknet-link"

          When creating an order on Block DX, there is no fee other than the network fee of the token being sold. This is the 
          same type of fee you would incur if sending this token to another party.

          When accepting an order on Block DX, a static fee of 0.015 BLOCK is charged at the time the order is taken. This fee 
          is charged even if a trade is canceled or fails and is meant to discourage malicious behavior on the network.
        </p>
        <p>  
          In addition to the 0.015 BLOCK fee, there is also the network fee of the token being sold. This is the same type of 
          fee you would incur if sending this token to another party.
